       readv, writev, preadv, pwritev - read or write data into multiple buffers
       #include <sys/uio.h>

       ssize_t readv(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);

       ssize_t writev(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);

       ssize_t preadv(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt,
                      off_t offset);

       ssize_t pwritev(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt,
                       off_t offset);

iov - scatter input 
fd - gather output

       The  readv() system call reads iovcnt buffers from the file associated with the file descriptor fd into the buffers
       described by iov ("scatter input").

       The writev() system call writes iovcnt buffers of data described by iov  to  the  file  associated  with  the  file
       descriptor fd ("gather output").

       The pointer iov points to an array of iovec structures, defined in <sys/uio.h> as:

           struct iovec {
               void  *iov_base;    /* Starting address */
               size_t iov_len;     /* Number of bytes to transfer */
           };


readv same as read except multiple buffers filled.

writev same as write except multiple muffers are written out. to fd.

preadv and pwritev

preadv = readv + offset

pwritev = writev + offset

-----------------------------------
       pread, pwrite - read from or write to a file descriptor at a given offset

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       ssize_t pread(int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);

       ssize_t pwrite(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);

read / write at given offset.

useful in multithreaded applications.

In linux, 
O_APPEND - means end of file / no respect to offset.
